# Machine Vision Project
This repository contains a multi-phase machine vision project focusing on image processing techniques. Each phase tackles a distinct aspect of image analysis and enhancement, with implementation details and evaluations included.

## Project Phases
### Phase 1 - 8-Bit Planes Analysis
- Extracted the 8-bit planes of a grayscale image.
- Set each bit plane to zero one by one and analyzed the visual and statistical effects.
- Documented insights on the significance of each bit plane in image representation.

### Phase 2 - Gamma Correction
- Applied gamma correction to an image to adjust brightness and contrast.
- Experimented with different gamma values to find the most visually and statistically optimal gamma.
- Documented the process and results with plots and evaluations.

### Phase 3 - Histogram Analysis and Equalization
- Calculated and plotted the histogram of a grayscale image to evaluate intensity distribution.
- Applied histogram equalization to enhance the image contrast.
- Compared the original and equalized images with visual and quantitative metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, opencv-python
